# 🐄 Image-Based Breed Recognition for Cattle and Buffaloes of India

## 📌 Overview
India is home to diverse indigenous breeds of **cattle** (e.g., Gir, Sahiwal, Red Sindhi, Tharparkar) and **buffaloes** (e.g., Murrah, Jaffarabadi, Mehsana, Surti).  
Manual identification of breeds requires expert knowledge and is often **time-consuming and error-prone**.  

This project develops an **AI-powered computer vision system** for **automatic breed recognition** using animal images.  
The system will help **farmers, veterinarians, researchers, and policymakers** in breed authentication, dairy management, and conservation programs.

## 🚀 Features
- 📷 Breed identification using **image classification**  
- 🎯 Fine-grained recognition of subtle features (horn shape, hump, face, coat color)  
- 📊 Confidence score for predictions  
- 📱 Mobile-friendly deployment for farmers  
- 🌐 Multilingual support for wider adoption  
- 🔄 Continuous learning with farmer-uploaded images  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: PyTorch / TensorFlow / Keras  
- **Models**: CNN, ResNet, EfficientNet, MobileNet (for lightweight mobile apps)  
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, Mask R-CNN (for segmentation)  
- **Deployment**: Flask / FastAPI (backend), React Native / Flutter (mobile app)  
- **Dataset Handling**: Custom dataset + augmentation (rotation, brightness, cropping)

## 📂 Dataset
Since no large public dataset exists for Indian breeds, images need to be:  
- Collected from **NDDB, ICAR, field surveys, veterinary universities**  
- Crowdsourced from farmers using a mobile app  
- Preprocessed with **background removal & augmentation**  

Target breeds include:  
- **Cattle**: Gir, Sahiwal, Red Sindhi, Tharparkar, Kankrej, Ongole, etc.  
- **Buffaloes**: Murrah, Jaffarabadi, Mehsana, Surti, Banni, etc.

## 📊 System Workflow
1. **Image Acquisition** – Upload or capture animal image  
2. **Preprocessing** – Resize, enhance, remove background  
3. **Feature Extraction** – CNN-based deep feature learning  
4. **Classification** – Multi-class breed prediction with confidence  
5. **Deployment** – Web/mobile application for real-world usage
